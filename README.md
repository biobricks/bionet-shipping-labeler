This is a work-in-progress pre-paid shipping label generation library for the bionet.

Currently it supports only the [https://www.easypost.com/ easypost] API.

# Beware

If someone gets ahold of your easypost API key from the `settings.js` file then they will be able to ship packages using your account. Make sure you set permissions appropriately, e.g. `chmod 600 settings.js`.
